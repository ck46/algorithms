## Algorithms 
This project implements the algorithms of the book Introduction to Algorithms, third edition, by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein.

The algorithms of each part of the book are implemented in the appropriate folder. The parts include:
  - Foundations - foundations
  - Sorting and Order Statistics - sorting
  - Data Structures - structures
  - Advanced Design and Analysis Techniques - design
  - Advanced Data Structures - structures
  - Graph Algorithms - graphs
The algorithms are implemented in the LISP language.

### Foundations
The following algorithms are implemented in the folder foundations:
  - insertion sort
  - merge sort
  
### Sorting and Order Statistics
The following algorithms are implemented in the folder sorting:

### Data Structures
The algorithms for the data structures and advanced data structures part are implemented in the folder structures:

### Advanced Design and Analysis
The algorithms

### Graph Algorithms
The following algorithms are implemented in the folder graphs:
