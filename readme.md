## Algorithms 
This project implements the algorithms of the book Introduction to Algorithms, third edition, by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein.

The algorithms of each part of the book are implemented in the appropriate folder. The parts include:
  - Foundations - foundations
  - Sorting and Order Statistics - sorting
  - Data Structures - structures
  - Advanced Design and Analysis Techniques - design
  - Advanced Data Structures - structures
  - Graph Algorithms - graphs

### Foundations
The following algorithms are implemented in the folder foundations:
  - insertion sort
  - merge sort
  
### Sorting and Order Statistics
